#Fend-Memory-Game:
First of all this game tests your memory and examine could you remember the icon inside every card you flipped.

#How to play the game & Instructions:
The game contains 16 cards every one of them hide an icon once you click on a card the icon appear to match it with another icon in another card, when two cards are different in their icons they flipped back and hide the icon again, otherwise when two cards are clicked and matched with same icons the cards will be unclick able and they take a different color, so all you have is to remember where are the matched cards to click to complete the game.

#Game Contents:
1- Timer: calculate the number of seconds have been taken one you clicked on the first card.
2- Moves: every two clicked cards is consider as a one move.
3- Stars: when you get three stars this is the best score and less stars you get the less number of icons you remember.
4- Restart Button: whish reset the game from the beginning once you clicked on.
5- Cards: 16 cards inside the big square every two cards contain the same icon which mean we have 8 different icons you have to match.

#How rating stars work:
The main idea of the game is to match all cards with minimum number of moves so when the number of moves increase you get less stars, so try to remember well every card you clicked ;).

#How I built:
I use a template from Nanodegree course which contains HTML, CSS& fontawesome that built the div (Box) which carry all cards and style them and finally give an icon to every card.

I also used JS code make the game dynamic and to respond to the player clicks.

At last I used sweetalert to make a beautiful popup window.
